  <p>Hello my fellow comrade. Clearly shown from the fact you are on this page,
  you want to play a great indie game.
  Well I present Flappy Pikachu with Window XP Startup Sound,
  used purely to annoy you and others around.
  This is the world's best game as it is created by a Russian.
  Don't doubt me, Russians are always right!</p>
