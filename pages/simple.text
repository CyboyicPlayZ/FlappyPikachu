
Hello my fellow comrade. Clearly shown from the fact you are on this page,
you want to play a great indie game.
Well I present Flappy Pikachu with Window XP Startup Sound,
used purely to annoy you and others around.
This is the world's best game as it is created by a Russian.
Don't doubt me, Russians are always right!

How to play:
- Press SPACE to flap your wings.
- Avoid the pipes.
- If you crash, just try again!
